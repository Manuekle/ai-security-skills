name: data-rag-security
description: Review or design security for application data, databases, uploads, object storage, vector search, RAG pipelines, embeddings, agent memory, and multi-tenant retrieval. Use whenever an AI application stores or retrieves user data, ingests documents, performs semantic search, maintains persistent memory, or exposes files and generated artifacts.

# Data and RAG Security

Review both confidentiality boundaries and data-to-model boundaries.

## Data access

Verify least-privilege database identities, encrypted connections where appropriate, scoped queries, tenant isolation and safe migrations/backups.

Resource authorization must remain effective at the query/storage layer; do not trust client-supplied tenant identifiers.

## Uploads

Validate:

- declared and detected file type
- size
- file name/path handling
- archive nesting and decompression limits
- parser safety
- malware scanning when required by product/threat model
- storage location
- access policy

Do not serve untrusted uploads from a context that grants them application origin privileges without appropriate isolation.

## Object storage

Review bucket/container permissions, signed URL scope/expiry, object naming, tenant prefixes, metadata leakage and deletion behavior.

## RAG ingestion

Treat documents as untrusted data. Separate ingestion from trusted system instructions.

Review:

```text
upload/source
-> validation
-> parser
-> chunking
-> metadata/tenant labeling
-> embedding
-> index
```

Ensure tenant and authorization metadata survive the entire pipeline.

## Retrieval

Perform authorization filtering before or during retrieval; do not retrieve globally and filter only after sensitive content enters model context.

Review top-k, metadata filters, reranking and cache boundaries for cross-tenant leakage.

## Poisoning and prompt injection

Retrieved content may contain malicious instructions. Keep retrieved text in an explicitly untrusted context and prevent it from redefining policies or tool authority.

## Memory

Separate:

- conversation context
- persistent user/agent memory
- knowledge/RAG corpus

Define ownership, retention, deletion, sensitivity and tenant scope for each.

## Logs and analytics

Avoid logging sensitive raw prompts/documents by default. Redact secrets/tokens and define retention appropriate to the data class.

## Additional resources

Read `references/rag-threats.md` for RAG-specific threat patterns.
